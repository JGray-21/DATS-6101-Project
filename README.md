* Main Questions and hypothesis(Josh)

We aim to use the GSS data set to answer the following questions: 
   How do people feel about our government? How has that changed since the 1970s? 
We plan to look at how different demographics feel about different aspects of our government and compare the answers to what they were in the 70's. Our goal is to find correlations between demographics and government sentiment. We also want to identify any trends as they appear throughout the years and investigate what might have caused any major shifts in sentiment.
