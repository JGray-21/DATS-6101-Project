## Years for each variable

```{r}
data(gss_all)
```

Age - Agee of respondent

```{r}
gss_which_years(gss_all, age)

```

Education - Highest year of school completed

```{r}
gss_which_years(gss_all, educ)
```

Income - Total family income

```{r}
gss_which_years(gss_all, income)
```

Looks like we're starting with 1973. Looking at region distribution in 73 and 18


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

# Load the datasets for 1973 and 2018
y73 <- gss_get_yr(1973)
y18 <- gss_get_yr(2018)

# Select the 'educ' column for both years
y73_f <- y73['educ']
y18_f <- y18['educ']

# Define the education categories
educ_labels <- c(
  "-99: No answer", "-98: Do not Know/Cannot Choose", "No formal schooling", 
  "1st grade", "2nd grade", "3rd grade", "4th grade", "5th grade", "6th grade",
  "7th grade", "8th grade", "9th grade", "10th grade", "11th grade", "12th grade", 
  "1 year of college", "2 years of college", "3 years of college", "4 years of college", 
  "5 years of college", "6 years of college", "7 years of college", "8 or more years of college"
)

# Map 'educ' values to categories
y73_f$educ <- factor(y73_f$educ, levels = c(-99, -98, 0:20), labels = educ_labels)
y18_f$educ <- factor(y18_f$educ, levels = c(-99, -98, 0:20), labels = educ_labels)

# Plot the education levels for 1973
